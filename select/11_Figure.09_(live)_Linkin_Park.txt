Alright, you guys
You guys feeling kinda warm right now?
I want you guys to take those shirts off and put 'em over your head
Put 'em up like this, y'all
Let's go, come on
Put 'em up, y'all
Put 'em up, y'all
Yes

Nothin' ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothin' I can do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
And didn't realize, instead of settin' it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away

And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

Come on

Hearin' your name, the memory comes back again
I remember when it started happenin'
I'd see you in every thought I had, and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committin' myself to 'em every day
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see
That I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away

And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

Put 'em up, y'all
You ready? Put 'em up, y'all
Put 'em up, y'all
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up

Get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I've kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you know
I've let you go, so get away from me
Gimme my space back, you gotta just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
Kept it in, but now I'm lettin' you know
I've let you go

And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you

That was pretty great, you guys
People in the pit, you doin' it right now, huh?
This dude's got a shirt on that says, "I'm here to mosh"
He's my favorite guy in the crowd, what's up, homie?
The pit master, right there
You guys ready to start this pit?
I like crazy mother-
We ready to get this pit goin'?
Put 'em up if you're ready to get the pit goin'
