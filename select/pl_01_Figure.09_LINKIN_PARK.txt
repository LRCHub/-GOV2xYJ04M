Nothing ever stops
all these thoughts
And the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder
why this is happening
It's like nothing
I can do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself
in the back again
'cause from the
infinite word I could say
I put all the pain you
gave to me on display
But didn't realize
instead of setting it free
I took what I hated
and made it a part of me
(It never goes away)
(It never goes away)
And now
You've become a part of me
(You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me
(You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate
(myself from what I've done)
Giving up a part of me
(I've let myself become you)
Hearing your name
the memories come back again
I remember
when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought
I had and then
the thoughts slowly found words
attached to them
and I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to them
and every day
I regret saying those thins
'cause now I see
that I took what I hated and
made it a part of me
(It never goes away)
(It never goes away)
And now
You've become a part of me
(You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me
(You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate
(myself from what I've done)
Giving up a part of me
(I've let myself become you)
(It never goes away)
(It never goes away)
(It never goes away)
(It never goes away)

Gimme my space
back you gotta just
Everything comes
down to memories of
I've kept it in but now
I'm letting you
I've let you go

Gimme my space
back you gotta just
Everything comes down
to memories of
I've kept it in but now
I'm letting you
I've let you go
And now
You've become a part of me
(You'll always be right here)
You've become a part of me
(You'll always be my fear)
I can't separate
(myself from what I've done)
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become you
I've let myself become
lost inside these
thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you
